# ðŸŒŠ ProjectCleanFlow

ProjectCleanFlow is a mobile-first reporting tool for flooding and other environment-related issues. Users can select affected areas on a map and submit data, which is sent to a backend server for processing. This app is designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind, targeting communities prone to seasonal flooding. 

## Goal
The App's Goal is to use Geospatial Data to send notification alerts to the user to warn them of potentially dangerous areas, through customizable notifications and prompts users will be subtly nudged to carry out certain actions ranging from littering awareness to re-routing to safer areas. 
We hope the app will attract widespread adoption where it will reach a critical mass of users so that we have a well connected network to support better diaster preparedness in the country.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### To run Backend (Flask Server)
1. `cd` to project directory
2. Run `python3 main.py` in terminal
3. Server will start on port 3000

### To run Frontend
1. Open a new terminal window
2. `cd` to project directory
3. Run `npm start`
4. Scan the QR code with your phone's camera

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 3000 Already in Use**
   - Check if another process is using port 3000
   - Kill the process or change the port in `main.py`

2. **"Not Found" Error on Mobile App**
   - Check if your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
   - Verify the IP address in `App.js` matches your computer's local IP
   - Test the backend URL in your computer's browser:
     ```
     http://YOUR_IP:3000/
     http://YOUR_IP:3000/leafletMap.html
     ```

3. **Connection Refused**
   - Make sure the Flask server is running
   - Check if your firewall is blocking the connection
   - Verify you're using the correct IP address

4. **WebView Not Loading**
   - Clear your app's cache
   - Restart both the Flask server and the Expo app
   - Make sure all files in the `public` directory are present

### Finding Your IP Address
- On MacOS: Run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` in terminal
- Use this IP in `App.js` for the WebView URL

### Verifying Server Status
1. Start the Flask server
2. Open your computer's browser
3. Try accessing `http://YOUR_IP:3000/`
4. You should see "ðŸš€ Flask backend is running!"

## ðŸ“± Usage Guide

1. **Starting the App**
   - Launch the app and allow location permissions
   - The map will center on your location
   - Or use the default location if permissions are denied

2. **Reporting a Flood Area**
   - Click the polygon tool (â¬¡)
   - Click four points on the map to define the area
   - Confirm or cancel using the side controls
   - Success message will appear when area is saved

3. **Managing Reports**
   - Click any drawn area to select it
   - Select the responding prompt as to carry out your action to delete , Yes or No.

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes
- Location data is only used to provide data for notification alerts.
- No personal data is stored without consent
- All communications are handled securely through secure networking (Google Firebase RTDB)

## SMS Notification System

The app uses Firebase Authentication for phone number verification and sends SMS notifications when users are within 100 meters of reported areas. This system works with Expo Go and doesn't require development builds.

### How it works:

1. **Phone Verification**: Users verify their phone number through the app menu
2. **Background Tracking**: The app tracks location in the background
3. **Proximity Detection**: When users are within 100m of a reported area, an SMS notification is triggered
4. **Rate Limiting**: Notifications are limited to once per 5 minutes per area to prevent spam

### Benefits over Expo Notifications:

- Works with Expo Go (no development build required)
- More reliable delivery
- Better user engagement
- Foundation for future monetization through SMS services

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure Firebase:
   - Update `src/services/firebase.js` with your Firebase configuration
   - Enable Phone Authentication in your Firebase console
   - Set up Firebase Realtime Database

3. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Firebase Configuration

Make sure to enable the following Firebase services:
- **Authentication** (Phone provider)
- **Realtime Database**
- **Cloud Functions** (optional, for actual SMS sending)

## Usage

1. **Report an Area**: Use the "Select Area to Report" button to draw a polygon on the map
2. **Verify Phone**: Go to the menu (â˜°) and select "Verify Phone" to enable SMS notifications
3. **View Reports**: Use "See Reported Areas" to view all reported areas on the map
4. **Notification History**: Check your notification history in the menu

## Technical Details

- **Map**: Leaflet.js embedded in React Native WebView
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Authentication**: Firebase Phone Authentication
- **Location**: Expo Location with background tracking
- **Notifications**: Custom SMS service (currently logs to console, ready for SMS integration)

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with actual SMS service (Twilio, AWS SNS, etc.)
- Push notifications for development builds
- User profiles and preferences
- Area categorization and filtering
- Community features and reporting
