# üåä ProjectCleanFlow

ProjectCleanFlow is a mobile-first reporting tool for flooding and other environment-related issues. Users can select affected areas on a map and submit data, which is sent to a backend server for processing. This app is designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind, targeting communities prone to seasonal flooding. 

## Goal
The App's Goal is to use Geospatial Data to send notification alerts to the user to warn them of potentially dangerous areas, through customizable notifications and prompts users will be subtly nudged to carry out certain actions ranging from littering awareness to re-routing to safer areas. 
We hope the app will attract widespread adoption where it will reach a critical mass of users so that we have a well connected network to support better diaster preparedness in the country.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### To run Backend (Flask Server)
1. `cd` to project directory
2. Run `python3 main.py` in terminal
3. Server will start on port 3000

### To run Frontend
1. Open a new terminal window
2. `cd` to project directory
3. Run `npm start`
4. Scan the QR code with your phone's camera

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 3000 Already in Use**
   - Check if another process is using port 3000
   - Kill the process or change the port in `main.py`

2. **"Not Found" Error on Mobile App**
   - Check if your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
   - Verify the IP address in `App.js` matches your computer's local IP
   - Test the backend URL in your computer's browser:
     ```
     http://YOUR_IP:3000/
     http://YOUR_IP:3000/leafletMap.html
     ```

3. **Connection Refused**
   - Make sure the Flask server is running
   - Check if your firewall is blocking the connection
   - Verify you're using the correct IP address

4. **WebView Not Loading**
   - Clear your app's cache
   - Restart both the Flask server and the Expo app
   - Make sure all files in the `public` directory are present

### Finding Your IP Address
- On MacOS: Run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` in terminal
- Use this IP in `App.js` for the WebView URL

### Verifying Server Status
1. Start the Flask server
2. Open your computer's browser
3. Try accessing `http://YOUR_IP:3000/`
4. You should see "üöÄ Flask backend is running!"

## üì± Usage Guide
